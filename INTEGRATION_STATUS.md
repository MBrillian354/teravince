# Backend Integration Test

This document outlines the integration between the ManageAccounts frontend component and the backend API.

## Backend API Endpoints

The following endpoints are now available at `http://localhost:5000/api/users`:

- `GET /api/users` - Get all users (requires authentication)
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user by ID (requires authentication)
- `POST /api/users` - Create new user (requires authentication)
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user (requires authentication)
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user (requires authentication)

## Frontend Integration

### ManageAccounts Page
- ✅ Fetches accounts from backend using `fetchAccounts` async thunk
- ✅ Displays loading states
- ✅ Shows error handling
- ✅ Computes statistics dynamically from real data
- ✅ Handles delete operations via backend API
- ✅ Links to create and edit forms

### NewAccountForm Page
- ✅ Creates accounts via backend using `createAccount` async thunk
- ✅ Includes password field for user creation
- ✅ Shows loading and error states
- ✅ Redirects to manage accounts after successful creation

### EditAccount Page
- ✅ New page created for editing accounts
- ✅ Loads existing account data from backend
- ✅ Updates accounts via backend using `updateAccount` async thunk
- ✅ Shows loading and error states
- ✅ Redirects after successful update

## Data Model Updates

### User Model (Backend)
- Updated to include `firstName`, `lastName` fields
- Added `jobTitle`, `position` fields to match frontend requirements
- Added `status` field with default value

### Redux Store (Frontend)
- Added async thunks for API integration
- Added loading and error states
- Transforms backend data format to match frontend expectations

## Authentication
- All user endpoints require valid JWT token
- Frontend automatically includes token in API requests
- Proper error handling for 401 unauthorized responses

## Testing
- Backend server running on http://localhost:5000
- Frontend server running on http://localhost:5173
- API endpoints responding correctly with authentication requirement
- All routes properly configured in React Router

## Next Steps
1. Test account creation from the frontend
2. Test account editing functionality  
3. Test account deletion
4. Verify statistics calculations with real data
